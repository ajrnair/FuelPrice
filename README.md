## 🔧 Data Updates

### ⚡ Automated Daily Updates (Recommended)

The repository includes **GitHub Actions** that automatically update fuel prices **every day at 6:30 AM IST**!

**How it works:**
- Scraper runs automatically via GitHub Actions
- Fetches real-time prices from multiple sources:
  - **NDTV** (primary source)
  - **GoodReturns** (fallback)
  - **MyPetrolPrice** (secondary fallback)
- Updates `data.json` with latest prices
- Commits changes automatically
- GitHub Pages auto-deploys the updated site

**To enable:** Just push the code to GitHub - the workflow runs automatically!

**Manual trigger:** Go to Actions tab → "Update Fuel Prices" → "Run workflow"

### 🔄 Manual Scraping

Run the scraper manually anytime:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run full scraper (all states)
python3 scraper.py

# Run quick test (4 states only)
python3 test_scraper.py
```

### ✏️ Manual Data Edit

You can also edit `data.json` directly with custom prices.

### 📊 Data Sources

The scraper uses multiple sources with automatic failover:
1. **NDTV Fuel Prices** - City-specific prices (e.g., https://www.ndtv.com/fuel-prices/diesel-price-in-ernakulam-city)
2. **GoodReturns** - State-wise aggregated data
3. **MyPetrolPrice** - Alternative city data
4. **Fallback estimation** - If all sources fail, uses reasonable estimates
